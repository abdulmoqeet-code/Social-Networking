#  Network Analysis of Colonial Privilege Distribution  
### Advanced Study of Influence in the Spanish Crown's Imperial Network

---

##  Introduction

Building on the *Empire of Networks* study, which examined how the Spanish Crown used the distribution of privileges as a tool for colonial governance, this project extends that work by offering a deeper and more structural analysis of **influence** within the network.

While the original research focused on grouping privileges by time and geographic region, our project explores the **internal structure of influence** using a combination of advanced **network science techniques**, including:

- Centrality measures (e.g., betweenness, closeness, eigenvector)
- Community detection
- Role differentiation (hubs and authorities)

---

##  Objectives

- Understand hierarchical relationships and flows of influence within the network.
- Identify key figures who acted as **intermediaries**, **connectors**, or **central authorities**.
- Reveal community structures and the roles individuals played within them.

---

##  Methodology

- The dataset is modeled as a **monomodal directed network**, where:
  - **Nodes** represent individual actors.
  - **Directed edges** represent the **granting of privileges** from one person to another.
  
- Using this representation, we analyze:
  - Influence propagation across the network
  - Network topology and structural roles
  - Central actors and bridge nodes

##  Technologies Used

- Python (NetworkX, Pandas, NumPy)
- Gephi (for interactive visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Graph Theory & Network Science

---

##  Key Features

- **Centrality Analysis**: Identifying influential individuals by various centrality metrics.
- **Community Detection**: Understanding clusters of influence and localized governance patterns.
- **Role Assignment**: Differentiating between hubs (information spreaders) and authorities (trusted sources).
